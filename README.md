Predict Future Sales
Data Science plays a huge role in forecasting sales and risks in the retail sector. Majority of the leading retail stores implement Data Science to keep a track of their customer needs and make better business decisions. For this final project we will do forecast by using different types of data mining algorithms to forecast the total amount of products sold in every shop. 

Problem Statement: To forecast the total amount of products sold in every shop for the test set

Data Set Description: The data set used for this project contains daily historical data from January 2013 to October 2015. For the analysis of this problem, the following predictor variables are used:
ID - an Id that represents a (Shop, Item) tuple within the test set
shop_id - unique identifier of a shop
item_id - unique identifier of a product
item_category_id - unique identifier of item category
item_cnt_day - number of products sold. You are predicting a monthly amount of this measure
item_price - current price of an item
date - date in format dd/mm/yyyy
date_block_num - a consecutive month number, used for convenience. January 2013 is 0, February 2013 is 1,..., October 2015 is 33
item_name - name of item
shop_name - name of shop
item_category_name - name of item category
By studying the dependency of these predictor variables on the response variable, we can predict or forecast sales for the upcoming months.
